# UE5VC-Perforce

## Overview

The **UE5VC-Perforce** project is a solution designed to integrate version control for Unreal Engine 5 projects using a Perforce server. It allows multiple devices to collaborate seamlessly on game development projects by providing versioning, collaboration, and file management support directly within Unreal Engine. This setup ensures that different teams working across various locations can efficiently manage their project files and changes.

This project is aimed at game developers, artists, and engineers who need a robust version control system to manage complex Unreal Engine 5 projects across multiple devices and contributors.

## Features

- Full integration with Unreal Engine 5 for version control.
- Real-time collaboration across multiple devices.
- Automated management of assets and dependencies.
- Ensures safe storage of project versions, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.
- Supports branching, merging, and rollback of project changes.
- Simplifies project coordination and conflict resolution in large teams.

## System Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)
- Perforce Helix Core server (P4D)
- Client machines with Perforce Helix Visual Client (P4V)
- Minimum 16GB RAM for client machines for handling large Unreal projects.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Perforce Helix Core

Follow these steps to install the Perforce Helix Core server on your host machine:

1. **Download and Install Perforce**: Download the latest version of the Perforce Helix Core server from the official [Perforce website](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-core-apps).
2. **Set Up the Server**: Once installed, configure the Perforce server with an admin user and define a workspace for your Unreal Engine project.

### 2. Install Unreal Engine 5

Make sure that Unreal Engine 5 is installed on all devices that need to connect to the Perforce server. You can download Unreal Engine from the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).

### 3. Install Perforce Visual Client (P4V)

For each client machine, download and install the Perforce Visual Client (P4V) to interact with the Perforce server. This tool helps manage file changes, check-ins, and updates.

### 4. Configuring Perforce with Unreal Engine 5

1. **Open your Unreal Project** in UE5.
2. **Enable Perforce Source Control**: Navigate to the **Edit > Plugins** menu, then enable the "Perforce Source Control" plugin.
3. **Set Up Source Control**:
   - In Unreal Engine, go to **File > Source Control > Connect to Source Control**.
   - Choose **Perforce** as the provider and enter the server's connection details (e.g., `P4PORT` and `P4USER`).
   - Enter the workspace name corresponding to your Perforce setup.

4. **Verify Connection**: Once connected, the version control toolbar will appear in Unreal Engine, indicating the status of your files.

### 5. Set Up Version Control Workflow

1. **Add Unreal Project to Perforce**: Right-click the project folder in Unreal Engine and select **Add Files** to start tracking your project under version control.
2. **Collaborate with Team Members**: Your team can now work on the same Unreal Engine project, commit changes, and update their local copies using Perforce.

### 6. Handling Large Files & Performance Optimization

Unreal Engine projects can be large, and it's essential to optimize your version control setup:

- **Enable Exclusive Check-Out**: For binary files (e.g., `.uasset`), enable exclusive check-out to prevent conflicts when team members work on the same asset.
- **Use Perforce Streams**: Set up branching workflows using Perforce streams for handling different project stages (e.g., development, testing, production).

## Usage

1. **Committing Changes**: After making changes in Unreal Engine, use the **Source Control** menu to submit files. Unreal will automatically check for file differences and display what needs to be checked in.
   
2. **Syncing Files**: Sync the latest changes from the Perforce server to keep your local workspace up to date. Go to **Source Control > Sync** or use the Perforce client.

3. **Branching and Merging**: For larger teams, leverage Perforce branching to manage feature branches and integrate them back into the main development branch.

## Best Practices for Version Control

- **Check-in Frequently**: Avoid large, infrequent check-ins. Regularly submit small, incremental changes.
- **Use Descriptive Messages**: Provide meaningful comments during check-ins to track changes easily.
- **Lock Critical Files**: Use Perforce’s lock feature to prevent simultaneous editing of critical files.
- **Review Before Committing**: Always review your changes locally before pushing to the server to prevent errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Failed**: Verify your server address, user credentials, and workspace configurations.
2. **File Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts using Perforce’s built-in merge tools or manually within Unreal Engine.

## Future Enhancements

The following are potential future updates to this project:

- Automated backup of Perforce server data.
- Integration of CI/CD pipelines with Perforce for continuous deployment and testing.
- Extended support for Unreal Engine Plugins and custom tools.
- Simplified workflows for branching and merging across large teams.
